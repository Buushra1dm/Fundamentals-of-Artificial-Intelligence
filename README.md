KGB GAME
This project aims to application the KGB game using artificial intelligence algorithms. In this project, we have implemented a stochastic algorithm that allows computer to look many moves ahead, thus picking the move that optimizes its chances of the winning.The draw is done randomly for each of the players, and the choice will fall on (girl / boy / king). The king can beat the boy, the boy can beat the girl, but only the girl can beat the king, and the winner is achieved based on this method.
